## Naive time for 100 vertices
    Naive execution time for 100 vertices = 1[ms]

## Naive time for 1000 vertices
    Naive execution time for 1000 vertices = 144[ms]
## Naive time for 10.000 vertices
    Naive execution time for 10000 vertices = 26058[ms] = 26,058[seconds]

## Naive time for 100.000 
    Still not calculated due to large amount of vertices.
